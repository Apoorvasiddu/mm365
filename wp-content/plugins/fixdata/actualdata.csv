It is impossible to manage these supply chains with longstanding and traditional tools. Our team can be at the center of this chaotic environment and help you ensure minimum downtime. We can support incoming and outbound expedited logistics and ensure material availability. On the shop floor hour by hour, follow-up is critical, and extended equipment failure is not acceptable.

GLADYS SMITH DEVELOPMENT GROUP LLC,"The Michigan Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, through the government,
provides rental assistance to income eligible families and individuals living in the State of
Michigan. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) and provides rent subsidies for very low-income people who find their
own housing in private homes and apartment buildings. This program has continuous
waiting lists, and the applicants are put on these waiting lists for any given period of time
before they are even approved or considered for the rental assistance. The applicant must
apply only to a county with an open waiting list available. These lists are available for
applications to apply into for only 3 months at a time. Currently, the Voucher Payment
Standard is 120% of the published FMR. A 2-bedroom rental payment voucher standard is
$1,300 and a 3-bedroom payment voucher standard is $1,645 per month. The problem is
that there are not enough houses to rent in the Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne counties in
Michigan to this low income approved rental assistance applicants. The waiting list for the
rental assistance program through Section 8 are very long and can take some time for
families and individuals to get into an available home. Because the payments can cover
some or all the voucher holders rent, they just need to locate the housing. GSDG LLC will
have the available housing with appliances and some furniture (beds, kitchen tables, etc.)
ready for the applicant(s) to move in. We will assist the applicant in the process of renting
the house with a rental agreement, expenditures of moving into the home, and the long-
term maintenance for the property (local landscaping, basic maintenance, and tax
assistance if home is purchased). There aren?t any other businesses that are participating
in this type of operation in the mentioned counties. GSDG LLC will be the first to implement
this structure which will fulfil our vision to stabilize and revitalize the underprivileged
community. By developing these houses for the low income approved Section 8 applicants,
we will get the waiting list moving by putting people into available homes that we will
develop.
The product and services we offer will be available move in ready houses to rent or
purchase through the government?s assistance, utilizing local contractors, installation
contractors for solar panel installation for energy savings, community-based businesses,
and micro-entrepreneurs for community development. Lastly, offering paid training and
trade programs to recruit minorities for community growth and revitalization.
Through many strategic partners we will develop the right team to fulfill the housing
development needs. The key participants will be local electricians, local plumbers, local
solar panel installation contractors, community land banks, local cement contractors,

Roasting Plant First National LLC,"Roasting Plant Detroit opened in the First National Building in downtown Detroit in February 2013 in the midst of the City's bankruptcy and represented the Company's first location outside of New York City. This new location included a brand refresh - complete with new logo, tagline, color palette and retail look/feel. It was also among the first brands to venture downtown, well before established brands such as Nike, Shake Shack and Warby Parker. In fact, the history of the Roasting Plant brand and the resurgence of Detroit go hand in hand - you cannot have a discussion about one without mentioning the other.
 
Our store was so well embraced by consumers, it was cash flow positive in its first month and continues to post impressive results even today. It goes without saying that the coffee is incredible, and the reviews from both customers and the media are extremely favorable (>220 4.5 Star reviews on Yelp and #1 rated in Detroit).
In November 2016, actor/author/activist Hill Harper and entrepreneur/investor Matty Yohannan purchased the Detroit location to much fanfare - not only as providing the freshest cup of coffee in the city but also as an engine of economic empowerment for Detroit and its young residents. They plan to open additional stores in and around Detroit and greater Michigan, as well as to build a large-scale Javabot? manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities - creating economic growth and much needed jobs. 

?Detroit is a great American city that was forged on innovation, social enterprise and entrepreneurship. My ownership of Roasting Plant Coffee in downtown Detroit builds upon that legacy. It is truly an honor and privilege for me to help fuel the Motor City, not just with Roasting Plant?s incomparable coffee?but by providing career paths and launching pads to greater success in a booming industry for young Detroiters hungry for opportunity and active mentorship,? said Harper. ""Having lived here filming two movies in Detroit over the past four years, I have come to love this city and its people. I believe in Detroit. It is truly a vibrant, unique and great American city.? -Hill Harper
Both Hill and Matty are direct investors in Roasting Plant, Inc. and serve as Advisors to the Company.

OUR COFFEE...
At Roasting Plant Detroit, we believe that every person deserves a perfect cup of coffee. No exceptions.
So we travel the planet in search of the highest grade specialty coffee beans and utilize our own state of the art roasting technology called Javabot to deliver a just-roasted, brewed-by-the-cup experience...
